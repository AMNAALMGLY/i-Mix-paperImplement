# i-Mix-paperImplement
This is an un-official implementaion of the [i-MIX : A DOMAIN -A GNOSTIC STRATEGY FOR CONTRASTIVE  REPRESENTATION LEARNING](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08887.pdf)-using pytorch.

I got accuaracy of 72% on Tabular data as the one in the paper with SimCLR . More experiments coming soon.

Major modules implemented in the code

- SimCLR Loss
- Tabular Model 
- Augementation for tabuler data
- Mixup
- Mixup with SimCLR loss
- Pre-training & Fine-tuning


### TODO

1. Use other modalities (images , speech)
2. Experiment Moco Loss and Byol Loss
3. Experiment different data sizes
4. Experiment with imagea without augmentation
5. covert code to .py
6. Improve documentation
